## ðŸ§  How It Works

1. **Data Collection**: Images are gathered from multiple sources and labeled by camera type or model.
2. **Preprocessing**: Image resizing, normalization, and optional EXIF extraction.
3. **Model Training**: A CNN (or other model) is trained to classify images based on visual features and/or metadata.
4. **Evaluation**: Accuracy and performance metrics are tracked to assess the classifier.
5. **Deployment**: Easily integrate the model into your application or run it as
